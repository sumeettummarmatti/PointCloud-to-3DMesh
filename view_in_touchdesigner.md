*✋🎮 INTERACTIVE 3D MESH MANIPULATION WITH HAND TRACKING*

This project integrates TouchDesigner and MediaPipe to create an interactive experience for viewing and manipulating 3D .obj files using intuitive hand gestures.

🧠 HOW IT WORKS:

The system uses both hands for gesture-based control:

• 🖐️ Left Hand – Rotation:
The index finger controls the mesh’s orientation, allowing smooth and precise rotation.

• 🤏 Right Hand – Scaling:
Pinch distance is used to zoom in and out, enabling dynamic scaling of the mesh in real-time.

🛠️ SETUP:

• Drag and drop your .obj mesh file into the provided .toe (TouchDesigner) file.
• A node-based workflow handles:
	•	Real-time mesh visualization
	•	Overlay of custom UI elements
	•	Hand tracking data via MediaPipe

This creates a rich, gesture-based control system for 3D content manipulation — ideal for:

• Interactive installations
• Digital art
• Educational demos

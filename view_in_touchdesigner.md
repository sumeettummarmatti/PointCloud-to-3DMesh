# **✋🎮 Interactive 3D Mesh Manipulation with Hand Tracking**

This project integrates **TouchDesigner** and **MediaPipe** to create an interactive experience for viewing and manipulating **3D `.obj` files** using intuitive hand gestures.

---

## 🧠 **How It Works**

The system uses both hands for gesture-based control:

- 🖐️ **Left Hand – Rotation**:  
  The index finger controls the mesh’s orientation, allowing smooth and precise rotation.

- 🤏 **Right Hand – Scaling**:  
  Pinch distance is used to zoom in and out, enabling dynamic scaling of the mesh in real-time.

## 🛠️ **Setup**

- Drag and drop your `.obj` mesh file into the provided `.toe` (TouchDesigner) file.  
- A **node-based workflow** handles:
  - ✅ Real-time mesh visualization  
  - ✅ Overlay of custom UI elements  
  - ✅ Hand tracking data via MediaPipe

This creates a **rich, gesture-based control system** for 3D content manipulation—ideal for:

- 🎨 Interactive installations  
- 🧩 Digital art  
- 📚 Educational demos

# üß± Skyfall  
### JSSATEB Hackwell

## üìå **Overview**

**Skyfall** is a powerful tool that converts point cloud data into coherent **3D meshes** using the **Marching Cubes** algorithm. It handles various point cloud formats regardless of capture method (LiDAR, photogrammetry, 3D Gaussian Splatting, etc.).

> Our method bypasses the limitations of traditional surface reconstruction techniques such as **Poisson reconstruction**, **Ball Pivoting**, and **Delaunay triangulation**, offering a more robust and efficient approach tailored to the nature of our data.

- While **Poisson reconstruction** is known for producing smooth surfaces, it often leads to **over-smoothing**, which results in the loss of fine geometric details‚Äîparticularly in areas with sharp features or sparse sampling.  
- **Ball Pivoting**, although intuitive and suitable for dense point clouds, is **highly sensitive to noise** and requires carefully tuned parameters like ball radius to produce accurate surfaces. Additionally, it may struggle to generate **watertight meshes** in cases of uneven sampling.  
- **Delaunay triangulation**, on the other hand, tends to produce **poorly shaped or non-manifold triangles** when applied to irregular or noisy datasets, which can compromise mesh quality and usability in downstream applications.  

> In contrast, **our method** is designed to be **resilient to noise**, **preserve detailed features**, and **generate high-quality, manifold meshes** efficiently, making it suitable for a wide range of practical applications.

## üìê **Technical Details: Marching Cubes Algorithm**

The algorithm converts a scalar field (distance values) into a triangle mesh by:

1. Creating a 3D grid and calculating distances to form a scalar field  
2. Determining an **iso-level threshold** that defines the surface boundary  
3. Processing each cube (voxel) to determine inside/outside configuration  
4. Generating triangles based on how the surface intersects each cube
